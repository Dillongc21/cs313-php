4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

    None.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

    The functionality of Heroku is pretty cool. It's really nice to have such a simple server setup to get an application

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.gi

    In addition to getting my application fully functional and meeting all assignment requirements, I also found a
    solution to having php 7.1 already installed on my machine. Using a homebrew package called homebrew-php, I installed
    version 5.6 and then the package uses symlinks to unlink from one version and link to another, so that you can toggle
    the two versions.
