            <p>
                Hi! I'm Dillon Christensen. I am a Computer Science Student and I have a wife and 6 month old son.
                I'm currently going to school full-time and working part-time in the IT Dept. of BYU-I as a software
                developer. I, ultimately, want to go into MERN stack web development.
